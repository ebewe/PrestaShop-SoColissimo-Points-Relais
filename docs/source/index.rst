PrestaShop Module - So Colissimo Points Relais
==============================================

The PrestaShop Module - **So Colissimo Points Relais** - allows you to propose So Colissimo Points Relais as a carrier.

For now the module is only available for PrestaShop 1.6.
FOR THIS MODULE TO WORK, YOU NEED TO HAVE A PROFESSIONNAL ACCOUNT ON www.colissimo.fr WITH A SUBSCRIPTION TO "SO COLISSIMO FLEXIBILITE".

The module works on the One Page Checkout.
The module only displays the Merchants (and NOT the cityssimo and post offices, which are more expensive).

It is easy to install and configure. This documentation will explain you how to do that.
